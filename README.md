# Security algorithms

This repo aims to cover all the things I'm learning about this amazing world.

 The first commit tried to show the vulnerabilities of hashing functions for short messages. A brute force program, the committed one,  can easily
 permute through all the variations, encrypt the variation with SHA256 and compare it with the given hash. If matches 
 then we have just found out the message!
